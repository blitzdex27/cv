        <h1>Dexter Ramos</h1>
        <p><em>A <strong>programmer</strong> and <strong>electrical engineer</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I am a career shifter. I worked as an instructor in a university to learn more about programming, and practice it in my classes at the same time. Although I did not experienced the ideal environment that I want in the university, I still
          pushed
          my passion in programming. After 2 and a half year, I bid farewell to properly pursue my passion. I purchased online courses to learn programming. I can't really explain why but it feels like I'm in heaven whenever I am learning
          programming.
          However, my savings is limited, so I had to search for a programming job that accepts entry level applicants. </p>
